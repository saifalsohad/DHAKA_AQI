***Data collection Method***
   Using the Python scripot i wrote i pulled the AQI index of dhaka city using API different times of the day. I manually run the program at diffetnet time of the day over the month of May and stored the informations in a Postgresql database. Then Using that data from the postgresql I made the dashboard in Tableau.
